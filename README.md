# thunderobot_zero_bios

This hosts the original backup of thunderobot zero 11th gen i7+3060 bios files and the unlocked bios file with all features.

advanced unlock(i7+3060).fd ---- unlocked bios
backup.fd ---- default bios by OEM

If you want to flash the bios available on this repo or backup your own bios all the .bat scripts are available and labeled (modify them accordingly).

I found this from the a tech forum; they used this modified bios to manually turn on/off the optimus mode on the laptop. all the original files along with the new Nvidia drives for the 3060 are attached here on this GDrive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bZNRviE5K-lNYSZVfvtZAM18mY2dbyo7/view?usp=sharing
